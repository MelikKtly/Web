  <p class="fs-5">
    Hello, my name is Melik Kutlay Atilla and I am studying Computer Engineering at SÃ¼leyman Demirel University.I am a person who wants to live my life to the fullest, so I try to try everything.That's why I took an active role in many clubs during my studies.These are respectively underwater scuba diving club, motor club, camping club and American football team.Since sports have a different place in my life, I paid more attention to American football. My American football team, which I captained, also won the 2nd place in Turkey and brought cups and medals to our university.Apart from that, I had the opportunity to develop myself abroad by going to the Erasmus student exchange program and I made many friends by traveling to many countries.Apart from these, I am interested in cyber security, so I am developing myself in this regard.If you want to take a look at my experiences, you can follow my instagram account in the attachment.</p>
